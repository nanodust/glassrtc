Undone by Apr 15th:
7. Move button to appropriate location
2. Can you create simple headers that separate the phrases for each act?
4. More generally. UI elements should start to be colored/sized/organized to reinforce the information hierarchy of interest to the admin.  You can use Qlab as a guide (except for their silly giant Go button). 
6. Start with a larger log window size, perhaps double.
5. Add number key shortcuts to select characters. (1, 2, 3, 4... )
7. Need another set of checkboxes to choose what lines to show. (I think sometimes this may be different than Send to / enabled. 
10. Need to try to get the Live Box working, though not perhaps for Monday.

1. In the history spreadsheet, newest entries should always be at the top.
: done
3. Highlight of current text in the list should be much easier to see â€“ it should change the whole background of the selected text cue.  
: done
8. Alphabetize Send To and Enabled lists.
: done
9. 'Space' to focus didn't seem to work on Firefox at some point after I was messing around with things.  Do you need to control focus on UI elements more carefully?
: please don't use Firefox
