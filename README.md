Glass RTC - minor tweaks to the glass-ready code at http://www.webrtc.org/demo



we've gotten it to work 30 minutes before overheating, just by limiting screen brightness & resolution (lousy 320x180)  

far from ideal - but it worked well for our needs. 

regarding codecs - the codecs of the TI OMAP CPU (page 3 (http://www.ti.com/lit/ml/swpt034b/swpt034b.pdf), lower left) don't match webRTC's VP8... (but if they did match, android would handle acceleration automatically). 

and while the OMAP 4 bulletin still gives hope for glass optimization / VP8 -  '...with the industryâ€™s broadest support for multimedia codecs available today as well as programmability to add support for future codecs' 

beyond what we were able to do in the time we had - but certainly a great target for someone with more resources...
